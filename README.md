# Basic_timmer
My first program using python - A basic timmer

To use this you will need 'winsound' module, to install it run:-

pip install winsound

After installing winsound, just run Timmer.py using python. Add the no of seconds as input and then press enter. To termiate alarm or program at any instant press ctrl+c.

(Only for windows as winsound is not supported yet on other platform!)
